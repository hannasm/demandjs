    <!-- by placing this iframe here (and hiding it) the browser requests the README.md and waits for it to fully load
         before moving on to parsing the rest of the page, later when demandjs requests that README.md the content is already 
         loaded and inserted into the DOM instantly.

         This is useful because, (at least in chrome) the browser completely renders the README.md before the pageLoad event
         is triggered. This means when you click a link to one of the tests, then hit the back button from the test to come
         back to this page, the browsers built-in scrollback mechanism will scroll down to the link you had clicked on to go to the test
         (e.g. where you were previously). If the request for README.md doesn't complete before the pageLoad event (and if the markdown
         code isn't inserted into the DOM before the pageLoad event) the browser will not do this scrolling for you and visiting
         tests will be pretty annoying.
